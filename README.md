# Front-End Development

This course will teach you how to realize your design ideas through code, going beyond ephemeral ideas and static images to a fully interactive in-browser prototype. You’ll gain the skills necessary to breakdown your design by the different constraints imposed by modern browsers, to lay it out in semantic HTML, to add style to it through crafted, organized CSS and to add behaviours and interactivity to it through basic Javascript.

The goal of the program is for you to come out feeling empowered to jump straight into designing with code in the browser, to build simple, beautiful sites and prototypes that more fully communicate your ideas to team members, clients and stakeholders.
